### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on _Share Free_. It is a virtual support groups platform. The tech stack includes:
    - Typescript
    - NestJs
    - MongoDB
    - Angular
    - Flutter
    - Azure
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React Native. Still evaluating the famous "React Native or Flutter" in my head.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Flutter plugins, npm packages, web projects, etc.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with the cheapest solution for enabling video conference in Flutter. Jitsi is great but requires either selfhosting or using JAAS (Jitsi as a service 😏) for authenticated usage.
- 💬 Ask me about web development. I love working on web development projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharma-vikashkr/).
