### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [_Share Free_](https://sharefree.co.in/). It is a virtual support groups platform. The tech stack includes:
    - Typescript
    - SocketIO
    - NestJs
    - MongoDB
    - Angular
    - Flutter
    - Azure
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
    - React Native. Still evaluating the famous "React Native or Flutter" in my head.
    - Tailwind. Really saving me a lot of trouble.
    - Flutter. Been working on it for a while and absolutely loving it.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Flutter plugins, npm packages, web projects, etc.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with the cheapest solution for enabling video conference in Flutter. Jitsi is great but requires either selfhosting or using JAAS (Jitsi as a service 😏 :cough: costly :cough:) for authenticated usage.
- 💬 Ask me about web development. I love working on web development projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharma-vikashkr/).
- 🙏 Would you like to support my work by [buying me a🍕](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/sharefree.co.in)?
